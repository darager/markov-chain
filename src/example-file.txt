F# is a functional programming language that makes it easy to write correct and maintainable code.
F# programming primarily involves defining types and functions that are type-inferred and generalized automatically. This allows your focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its data, rather than the details of programming.
F# has full support for objects, which are useful data types when you need to blend data and functionality. F# functions are used to manipulate objects.
F# functions are also first-class, meaning they can be passed as parameters and returned from other functions.
Rather than writing code that is object-oriented, in F#, you will often write code that treats objects as another data type for functions to manipulate. Features such as generic interfaces, object expressions, and judicious use of members are common in larger F# programs.
